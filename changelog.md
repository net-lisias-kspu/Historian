* Add text node parameters for date support:
  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
  * MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.
* Fix: MET was incorrectly calculated for periods > 1 day.

  * SrfSpeed - surface speed (same as Speed)
  * OrbSpeed - orbital speed
* `Longitude` and `LongitudeDMS` parameters always reports value between -180° (W) and +180° (E)
* Optional `BackgroundTexture` parameter for flag nodes. Allows adding a background texture to transparent flags. e.g. `BackgroundTexture = Squad/Flags/minimalistic` (simple "rippled" white flag background)
