	+ Add text node parameters for date support:
		- DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
		- YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
		- DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
		- MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.
	+ Fix: MET was incorrectly calculated for periods > 1 day.

			- OrbSpeed - orbital speed
		- `Longitude` and `LongitudeDMS` parameters always reports value between -180째 (W) and +180째 (E)
		- Optional `BackgroundTexture` parameter for flag nodes. Allows adding a background texture to transparent flags. e.g. `BackgroundTexture = Squad/Flags/minimalistic` (simple "rippled" white flag background)
